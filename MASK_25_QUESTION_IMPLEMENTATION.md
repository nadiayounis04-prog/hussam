# MASK NODE — 25-QUESTION DIAGNOSTIC IMPLEMENTATION

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete **MASK NODE 25-Question Diagnostic** with the exact specifications provided. The system now includes all 5 stages with 5 questions each, proper scoring logic, and a complete 25-outcome diagnosis grid.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **5 Developmental Stages** (5 questions each = 25 total)
- **Stage 1: The Shapeshifter** (Questions 1-5)
  - Instantly adapts to others' expectations
  - Needs: Balance between fitting in and staying authentic
  
- **Stage 2: The Chameleon** (Questions 6-10)
  - Changes style to match different environments while maintaining core identity
  - Needs: Act consistently while still being adaptable
  
- **Stage 3: The Player** (Questions 11-15)
  - Performs different roles and personas, often losing self in the act
  - Needs: Use performance to share something real rather than losing self
  
- **Stage 4: The Disguiser** (Questions 16-20)
  - Hides behind complex disguises and personas when threatened
  - Needs: Reveal small truths to stay anchored
  
- **Stage 5: The Revealer** (Questions 21-25)
  - Speaks truth and reveals authentic self, even when risky
  - Needs: Master being unveiled while maintaining wisdom about when to reveal

### 2. **Exact Question Implementation**
- **All 25 questions** implemented exactly as specified
- **5 answer choices** per question with **1-5 value scale**
- **Proper value mapping** where higher values (5) = more authentic/advanced behavior
- **Question randomization** during quiz for better user experience
- **Stage-specific questions** that accurately measure each developmental stage

### 3. **Complete Scoring System**
- **Dominant Stage** = highest total score (where user truly is)
- **Mask Stage** = lowest total score (where user hides/sabotages/regresses)
- **Tiebreaker logic** for equal scores
- **Dynamic value scale support** (1-5 scale for Mask, compatible with 1-4 scales for other archetypes)
- **Progress level calculation** (stuck, progressing, passed) based on score thresholds

### 4. **25-Outcome Diagnosis Grid**
- **Complete mapping** of all (Dominant|Mask) combinations
- **Poetic, field-style messages** for each outcome
- **Structured diagnosis** with:
  - Title (e.g., "The Shapeshifter | Mask: The Pure Shapeshifter")
  - Diagnosis (core insight about the combination)
  - Reality (how the field perceives this combination)
  - Tension (the internal conflict or challenge)
  - Law to Walk (specific guidance for growth)
  - If You Stay (consequences of inaction)
  - If You Act (benefits of taking action)

### 5. **Technical Implementation**
- **Updated `mask.ts`** with complete stage definitions and all 25 questions
- **Enhanced `quizScoring.ts`** already supports 1-5 value scale
- **Updated results page** for dynamic value scale support
- **Maintained compatibility** with existing 1-4 scale archetypes
- **Integrated with existing quiz system** - no additional components needed

## Key Features

### **Modular Design**
- Can be copied for any archetype
- Just update stage names, questions, and 25 outcomes
- Maintains consistent structure across all archetypes

### **Dynamic Value Scale Support**
- Automatically detects 1-4 vs 1-5 scales
- Adjusts scoring thresholds accordingly
- Maintains backward compatibility

### **Complete Integration**
- Works with existing quiz UI components
- Supports question randomization
- Includes progress tracking and stage indicators
- Provides detailed results with diagnosis

### **Field-Style Messaging**
- Poetic, evocative language
- Focuses on field dynamics and personal growth
- Provides actionable guidance for each outcome

## Usage

### **Access the Quiz**
- Navigate to `/chamber/mask/the-path/stage-test`
- Quiz automatically loads the 25-question Mask diagnostic
- Questions are randomized for better user experience

### **Take the Quiz**
- Answer all 25 questions (5 per stage)
- Progress bar shows completion
- Stage indicators show current question's stage
- Auto-advances after 1.5 seconds

### **View Results**
- Complete diagnosis with dominant and mask stages
- Detailed explanation of your combination
- Specific guidance for growth and development
- Progress levels for all 5 stages

## Example Outcomes

### **The Shapeshifter | Mask: The Pure Shapeshifter**
- **Diagnosis**: "You instantly become what's wanted in every situation. Your adaptability is perfect, but you've lost yourself completely."
- **Reality**: "The field recognizes your perfect adaptation but cannot find your authentic self."
- **Law to Walk**: "Begin to hold to your truth while still being adaptable."

### **The Revealer | Mask: The Pure Revealer**
- **Diagnosis**: "You speak truth and reveal your authentic self, even when it's risky or uncomfortable."
- **Reality**: "The field recognizes your complete commitment to truth and authenticity."
- **Law to Walk**: "Continue being naked truth while helping others reveal their authentic selves."

## Technical Details

### **File Structure**
```
hussamallah/lib/archetypes/mask.ts - Complete Mask archetype with 25 questions
hussamallah/lib/quizScoring.ts - Scoring logic (already supports 1-5 scale)
hussamallah/app/chamber/[archetype]/the-path/stage-test/page.tsx - Quiz UI
hussamallah/app/chamber/[archetype]/the-path/stage-test/results/page.tsx - Results UI
```

### **Scoring Logic**
- Each stage gets 5 questions
- Maximum score per stage: 25 points (5 questions × 5 points each)
- Progress thresholds:
  - Stuck: ≤ 8 points
  - Progressing: 9-14 points  
  - Passed: ≥ 15 points

### **Diagnosis Mapping**
- 5 dominant stages × 5 mask stages = 25 possible outcomes
- Each outcome has complete diagnosis structure
- Provides specific guidance for each combination
